                <p>
                    The following Terms of Service define the legal framework
                    for the use of the Hybright website (<a
                        href="https://klima.com/"
                        >Hybright.com</a
                    >), the Hybright app, and the other services we provide to
                    our users.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>Please read these Terms of Service carefully.</p>
                <p>1. Applicability</p>
                <p>
                    1.1 Contract partners and contract subject
                    matter.&nbsp;These Terms of Service provide the basis for
                    the user agreement resulting between you and us, Planetary
                    Emergency Hub, Akazienstr. 3A, 10823 Berlin, Germany
                    (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Us&quot; or
                    &quot;We&quot;). The contract subject matter is the use,
                    free of charge, of the services offered by Us on the
                    website&nbsp;<a href="https://klima.com/">Hybright.com</a>
                    (the &ldquo;Hybright Website&rdquo;) or via the Hybright
                    mobile applications (the &ldquo;Hybright App&rdquo;) and the
                    purchase of CO2e emission reduction quotas that We retire on
                    your behalf, as well as other services that may be
                    referenced in these Terms of Service (the &quot;Hybright
                    Services&quot;).&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.2&nbsp;Additional terms and conditions.&nbsp;We reserve
                    the right to make certain Hybright Services subject to
                    additional terms and conditions. We will notify you before
                    using such additional terms and conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you access the Hybright Services via the Hybright App and
                    have downloaded the Hybright App from the app store of a
                    third party, the Terms of Service of the app store provider
                    will apply in addition to our own Terms of Service. In case
                    of the Apple App Store, these terms include, for example,
                    the &quot;Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions&quot;
                    (available at
                    https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/de/terms.html).
                    The terms of use for Google Play are available, for example,
                    at&nbsp;<a
                        href="https://play.google.com/intl/de_de/about/play-terms.html"

                    >. Please be sure to review the terms of use for your
                    country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event of any conflicts, the latter terms of use will
                    take precedence.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>2.&nbsp;The Hybright Services&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The Hybright Services We provide involve the following:</p>
                <p>
                    2.1 Hybright App. You can download and use the Hybright App
                    for free. Using the Hybright App, all users can calculate
                    their personal carbon footprints. You can also use the
                    Hybright App to purchase carbon offsets.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    When downloading and using the Hybright App, especially in
                    third-party networks or abroad, you may incur transmission
                    charges from your Internet service provider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We make every effort to ensure the trouble-free operation of
                    the Hybright Services and to make them available 24/7 to the
                    extent possible. However, We would like to point out that
                    full or uninterrupted availability is not technically
                    feasible and We therefore do not guarantee trouble-free
                    operation or any particular availability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.2 Hybright Website. We also offer you the Hybright
                    Website, which provides information about the topics of
                    climate and emissions reduction and about our Hybright
                    Services. Some of the other Hybright Services (such as
                    calculating the carbon footprint) can also be used on the
                    Hybright Website. Where applicable, the terms and conditions
                    for using the various Hybright Services also apply to their
                    use on the Hybright Website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.3&nbsp;Calculation of carbon footprint.&nbsp;We enable our
                    users to calculate their personal annual CO2e emissions, the
                    so-called carbon footprint, free of charge. For this purpose
                    We make available a questionnaire in the Hybright App or on
                    the Hybright Website. The questionnaire allows users to
                    input information about their personal lifestyle (e.g. size
                    of apartment, number of flights). The method used to
                    calculate the carbon footprint is backed by science, but the
                    calculated carbon footprint is only an approximate value
                    because the exact carbon footprint depends on all of a
                    user&apos;s actions and only a limited amount of information
                    about each user is available to Us. It is also necessarily
                    an estimate because the carbon footprint is a prediction
                    about the future and the carbon footprint is calculated for
                    an entire year. Therefore, the calculation is made without
                    any guarantee that your actual carbon footprint will
                    correspond to your calculated carbon footprint. The method
                    of calculation may be adjusted from time to time, for
                    example because further findings are incorporated into the
                    calculation methodology or because social conditions
                    influencing your personal carbon footprint have changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.5 News. As part of the carbon offsetting process, our
                    users receive news about topics such as climate change in
                    general, about specific climate protection projects, and
                    about a climate-friendly lifestyle, in particular tips on
                    how to reduce your own carbon emissions and thus lower your
                    personal offset costs. This information may contain links to
                    third party content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.6 Changes to the Hybright Services. We reserve the right
                    to change our business model at any time, e.g., to provide
                    certain Hybright Services only in exchange for
                    payment.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Conditions of Participation. To open a user account and
                    to use the Hybright Services you must be at least 18 years
                    old and have full legal capacity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By entering into a contract with Us you represent that you
                    have no other user account with Us and that your user
                    account has not been suspended or canceled in the past due
                    to violations of our Terms of Service. In such cases We will
                    not enter into another or new user agreement with you. You
                    also represent that all information provided by you during
                    the registration process is true and complete.
                </p>
                <p>4. User Account and Conclusion of Contracts</p>
                <p>
                    4.1 Use without user account. You may use the Hybright App
                    or the Hybright Website to collect information without a
                    user account and, for example, to calculate your personal
                    carbon footprint. These Terms of Service also apply to this
                    type of use, to the extent that they are applicable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.2 Registration process. To use all features of the
                    Hybright Services, you must register and open a user
                    account. You can open a user account either via the Hybright
                    App or, if applicable, directly via the Hybright Website.
                    During the registration process you will be asked to accept
                    these Terms of Service and to consent to the processing of
                    your personal data. In addition, We will ask you to read our
                    privacy policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can either register and log in with your email address
                    and a password or use your Facebook login, your Google
                    account, or the &quot;Login with Apple&quot; feature.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    How the user agreement is concluded depends on how you log
                    in for the first time and whether you also participate in
                    our Carbon Offset Program.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.3 Registration via mobile Hybright App. If you wish to
                    register via the Hybright App, the conclusion of the user
                    agreement will depend on the rules of the app store
                    provider. As a general rule, a user agreement will result as
                    soon as you click on the install button in the app store and
                    enter your password or confirm installation with your
                    fingerprint or Face-ID. In order to use the Hybright
                    Services, you will still need to create a user account via
                    the Hybright App.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.4 Registration via the Hybright Website. If you register
                    on the Hybright Website, a user agreement between you and Us
                    will result after you have completed the registration
                    process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.5. Correction of input errors. If you want to participate
                    in our Carbon Offset Program using your Hybright App, you
                    can cancel the registration process at any time in the App.
                    You can also cancel the registration process at any time if
                    you wish to participate in our Carbon Offset Program via the
                    Hybright Website. You will be able to correct any input
                    errors until you have successfully entered your payment
                    details.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Services are offered exclusively to consumers. This means

                            or impair the functionality of the Hybright
                            Services;

                    the terms of contracts with any third parties, in particular

                    provider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To guarantee smooth communication with you, We ask that you
                    include our email address in the list of trusted senders at
                    your email provider.

                    7.2 User account. You may delete your user account at any
                    time for any or no reason, in which case this user agreement
                    will terminate automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do so, you must send Us an email
                    at&nbsp;support@Hybright.com, so that We can delete your
                    user account and the associated data. Please note that after
                    your user account has been deleted, all data and content you
                    have uploaded will or may be deleted by Us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If at the time of deletion of your user account you are
                    still participating in our Carbon Offset Program, the
                    Program will not terminate until the end of the current
                    billing period and your user account will not be deleted
                    until then. Any amount already paid by you for this billing
                    period will not be refunded, not even on a prorated
                    basis.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may terminate the user agreement on two week&apos;s prior
                    written, signed or unsigned, notice by email, however at the
                    earliest at the end of the current billing period of your
                    Carbon Offset Program.

                    7.3 Termination for good cause. Irrespective of the
                    aforementioned provisions, the right to terminate the
                    contract for good cause shall remain unaffected for both
                    parties. In particular, We are entitled to terminate the
                    user agreement or your Carbon Offset Program and to delete
                    your user account with immediate effect, if you seriously or
                    repeatedly violate the provisions of the user agreement
                    and/or these Terms of Service or fail to make any payment
                    when due despite a past due notice.&nbsp;

                <p>
                    Licensed rights will in each case terminate if your account
                    is no longer activated or after the license term has ended.
                    In the event of any violation of these provisions, we shall
                    have the right to terminate the contract for good cause
                    without notice.

                    publicly available (by wire-based or wireless transmission),
                    communicate, and edit such content (for example, by changing
                    the resolution or size of an image for technical reasons).
                    You hereby further license to Us the right to make any

                    application (such as the Hybright App) for your terminal
                    device on a permanent basis, if technical developments
                    should limit the functionality of your terminal device.

                <p>
                    13.1 No liability of app stores. We are fully responsible
                    for operating and offering the Hybright Services. The app

                    responsible for maintaining and providing support for the
                    Hybright App in accordance with these Terms of Service. The
                    app stores (of Google and Apple) assume no obligations to
                    provide any maintenance or support services with respect to

                    app stores have no further obligations as a result of any
                    malfunctions of the Hybright App.

                    13.4 Infringement of intellectual property rights of third
                    parties. In the event that third parties bring any claims
                    based on any infringement of intellectual property rights by

                    stores will not be responsible for any investigations,
                    defenses, resolution, or settlement of such infringement
                    claims.

                    accept and agree that the app stores shall be third-party
                    beneficiaries of these Terms of Service and that they may
                    therefore enforce these Terms of Service against you. Any

                <p>14. Responsibility for Content and Services</p>
                <p>
                    14.1 No responsibility for third-party content or
                    services.&nbsp;The Hybright Services may include links to
                    content or services of third-party providers. In some cases,
                    content made available by third parties may be shown or the
                    Hybright Services may enable you to use additional services
                    of third parties. We strive to design our applications in
                    such a way that this will be readily apparent to you. All
                    content and/or services of third-party providers are subject
                    to the applicable terms, conditions, and policies of such
                    third-party providers. We hereby expressly disclaim any
                    responsibility or liability for content or services of any
                    third parties. You are personally responsible for making
                    sure that you do not violate the terms and conditions of
                    such third-party providers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    14.2 No responsibility for user-generated content.&nbsp;You
                    are personally responsible for all content you upload using

                <p>
                    14.3 Responsibility of the user for violations of
                    law.&nbsp;When posting or making available your own content,
                    you must comply with all applicable laws and other
                    regulations that are applicable in the country in which you
                    are using our Hybright Services. Whether or not prohibited
                    by criminal law, you are generally prohibited from making
                    available content of a pornographic, sexual, violent,
                    racist, inflammatory, discriminatory, offensive and/or
                    defamatory nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, it is your responsibility to make sure that you
                    infringe no third-party rights, including, without
                    limitation, privacy or publicity rights of third parties and
                    intellectual property rights of third parties (e.g.,
                    copyrights, trademark rights, etc.). In this connection, We
                    advise you that you must also, and in particular, own the
                    necessary rights to your profile image and to any other
                    photos you upload.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may at any time remove and erase any content that is
                    unlawful or violates the aforementioned principles. If you
                    violate the aforementioned provisions, We shall also have
                    the right to send you a warning that We will suspend your
                    user account or terminate the user agreement for good cause.

                <p>
                    14.4 Indemnity.&nbsp;In the event that you have wrongfully
                    (negligently or intentionally) violated any provisions of
                    Section 14.3, you are obligated to indemnify Us against any
                    claims of third parties that may be brought as a result of
                    such violations. We further reserve the right to claim
                    damages and to pursue other remedies.
                </p>
                <p>15. Liability</p>
                <p>
                    15.1 Liability for free services.&nbsp;In case of free
                    services, our liability, whatever the legal basis, is
                    limited exclusively to damages resulting from intentional or
                    grossly negligent actions or omissions or from any lack of
                    warranted qualities. Our liability for intentional actions
                    or omissions is generally unlimited. Our liability for gross
                    negligence or any lack of warranted qualities is limited to
                    reasonably foreseeable damages. In all other cases any
                    liability on our part is excluded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    15.2 Liability for paid services.&nbsp;In case of paid
                    services, our liability, whatever the legal basis, is
                    generally unlimited for damages resulting from intentional
                    or grossly negligent actions or omissions or from any lack
                    of warranted qualities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If We breach any material contractual obligations due to
                    ordinary negligence, our liability is limited to reasonably
                    foreseeable damages. A contractual obligation is material
                    within the meaning of the foregoing sentence if its
                    performance is necessary for achieving contractual purposes
                    and if you, the consumer, may reasonably rely on its
                    performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our liability for wrongful harm to life, limb, or health
                    remains unaffected by the foregoing limitations.
                </p>
                <p>In all other cases any liability on our part is excluded.</p>
                <p>
                    15.3 Liability of our employees.&nbsp;The above limitations
                    of liability (see Sections 15.1 and 15.2) also apply for the
                    benefit of our employees and agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    15.4 Personal injuries. Any liability for damages involving
                    harm to life, limb, or health (&quot;personal
                    injuries&quot;) remains unaffected and is governed by
                    applicable law.

                    17. Changes to Terms of Service.&nbsp;We reserve the right
                    to make changes to these Terms of Service or any parts
                    thereof with effect for the future for the following
                    reasons, unless such changes would result in an unreasonable
                    disadvantage for you: for legal or regulatory reasons; for
                    security reasons; to upgrade or optimize existing features
                    of the Hybright Services or to add new features; to account
                    for the progress of technology, to make technical
                    adjustments, or to guarantee the future functionality of the
                    Hybright Services. We will notify you of any changes to our
                    Terms of Service at the latest four weeks before the planned
                    effective date of the new version. You will have the
                    opportunity to object to changes within the aforementioned
                    four-week period. If you continue to use our Hybright
                    Services without objection, you will be deemed to have
                    accepted the new Terms of Service. If you do object to
                    changes, We hereby expressly reserve our right to terminate
                    the contract for convenience. If and when We make changes to
                    the Terms of Service, We will once again advise you of your
                    revocation right, the time period within which the
                    revocation right must be exercised, and the legal
                    consequences of revocation.
                </p>
                <p>18. Changes to our Company, New Owners&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    18.1. Transfer of contracts to subsidiaries. In the future
                    We may change the structure of our company in order to
                    better offer the Hybright Services also worldwide or because
                    this makes economic sense for us. In this case We must be
                    able to transfer our contracts with you to subsidiaries. You
                    hereby agree that if you use the Hybright Services, We may
                    transfer our contracts with you to subsidiaries. Of course,
                    We will inform you before this happens. The Hybright
                    Services will continue to be available to you as usual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    18.2 New owners. If there is a change in the ownership or
                    voting rights in our company as a whole or with respect to
                    any of the Hybright Services or their assets, We may
                    transfer your information to the new owner. This applies in
                    particular for the benefit of any legal successors in the
                    event of a sale or other transfer of our business.
                </p>
                <p>19. Final Provisions</p>
                <p>19.1 Official contract language.</p>
                <p>The official contract language is&nbsp;German.</p>
                <p>19.2 Governing substantive law.</p>
                <p>
                    All dealings between the parties are governed exclusively by
                    German law, with the exception of the provisions of
                    the&nbsp;UN Convention on Contracts for the International
                    Sale of Goods (CISG). Business transactions with consumers
                    residing in the European Union may also be subject to the
                    law that is applicable at the place of the consumer&apos;s
                    residence, if and to the extent that mandatory consumer
                    protection provisions are involved.
                </p>
                <p>19.3 Venue and Jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>
                    If there is no court in Germany or another EU country where
                    venue and jurisdiction is proper based on your residence,
                    habitual abode, or corporate domicile (allgemeiner
                    Gerichtsstand), or if you relocate your permanent place of
                    residence to another country outside the EU after the
                    effective date of these Terms of Service, or if your place
                    of residence or habitual abode is unknown at the time legal
                    action is filed, exclusive venue and jurisdiction for any
                    and all disputes arising from this Agreement will be in the
                    courts at the place of our registered office.
                </p>
                <p>19.4 Severability.</p>
                <p>
                    If any provisions of these Terms of Service should be or
                    become invalid in whole or in part, the validity of the
                    remaining provisions will remain unaffected thereby. The
                    foregoing provisions apply,&nbsp;mutatis mutandis, if any
                    provisions should have been inadvertently omitted from these
                    Terms of Service.

                <p>
                    In some countries you have a legal right of revocation. This
                    is the case, for example, in all countries of the European
                    Union. You can find out whether you have a legal right of
                    revocation by referring, for example, to the terms of use of
                    your app store. Please refer to those terms of use to find
                    out to what extent you have such rights. In the United
                    States, for example, you have no right of revocation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a legal right of revocation, please read the
                    following information about how you can exercise this right
                    and what revocation will mean for you.
                </p>
                <p>22.1 Information about revocation.</p>
                <p>
                    If you have a legal right of revocation, this right will
                    come into existence as soon as you enter into a user
                    agreement or a contract for the participation in the Carbon
                    Offset Program with Us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may revoke the contract within 14 days of the contract
                    date for any or no reason, in which case the contract will
                    be unwound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To exercise your right of revocation, you must clearly
                    notify Us (e.g., by mail, telefax, or email) that you no
                    longer wish to be bound by the contract. For this purpose
                    you may, but do not have to, use the attached standard
                    revocation form. Any clear notice will suffice. If you
                    exercise this option, We will confirm receipt of your notice
                    of revocation (e.g., by email). Your notice of revocation
                    will be timely as long as you send it before the revocation
                    period has expired. Please address any notice of revocation
                    to the following address:

                <p>22.2 Consequences of revocation.</p>
                <p>
                    If you revoke the contract, the contract will be unwound.
                    You will receive a refund for any payments you have already
                    made for the revoked contract. We will issue the refund at
                    the latest 14 days after We receive your notice of
                    revocation. The refund will be made by the same method you
                    used for the original transaction, unless We expressly agree
                    otherwise with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have requested that services begin during the notice
                    period for revocation, you must compensate Us for such
                    reasonable amount as corresponds to the volume of services
                    that were provided before the time you notified Us of your
                    exercise of the right to revoke the contract relative to the
                    total volume of services provided for in the contract.
                </p>
                <p>22.3 Standard form for notice of revocation.</p>
                <p>
                    You may use the following form for your notice of
                    revocation.
                </p>

                    You can copy and paste into an email or print out the

                <p>
                    The European Commission makes available a platform for
                    online dispute resolution (OS platform). You can access the

                </p>
                <p>
                    We prefer to address any concerns you may have directly and
                    therefore do not participate in any consumer mediation
                    proceedings. Please contact Us directly with any questions
                    or problems.

                <p>Consent to data processing</p>
                <p>
                    We use technology (such as cookies) to analyze how you use
                    the Hybright App and the Hybright Website and to deliver
                    personalized/targeted advertising to you. For these
                    purposes, We or our partners create pseudonymised user
                    profiles. For this purpose, We ask you for your consent,
                    which you give together with your agreement to the Terms of
                    Service mentioned above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some cases, our partners and service providers also
                    process your personal data in so-called third countries, in
                    particular in the United States of America. At the same
                    time, you agree in accordance with Art. 49 para. 1 sentence
                    1 lit. a GDPR that your data may be processed in the USA,
                    with the risk of secret access by US authorities and use for
                    monitoring purposes, possibly without the possibility of
                    legal recourse.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you access content from third parties which We integrated
                    in our Services, data will be transferred to the provider of
                    such third-party content. By accessing the content, you
                    consent to the respective processing of your personal data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will find further information as well as notes on the
                    possibilities of discontinuation, revocation and objection
                    in our data protection regulations and in the data
                    protection regulations of the respective partners and
                    service providers.

                    You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the
                    future. We explain the details in our privacy policy, which
                    you can view before giving your consent. Your revocation
                    does not affect the legality of the data processing before
                    your revocation. If you revoke your consent, unfortunately
                    We can no longer provide you with climate services. If you
                    wish to revoke your consent, please contact our support
